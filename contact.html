            <p>You can reach me at:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="mailto:maya.l.hazarika@gmail.com">my email</a></li>
                <p>
                    You can reach me by email, which is the fastest way
                    to get a hold of me. I check it regularly and try
                    to reply within a few days, sometimes sooner.
                </p>

                    I have an Instagram account, but I don’t post much there.
                    It’s mostly a place to follow along if you want to see
                    some of my interests and things I like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    LinkedIn is where I share more current updates about me,
                    like school projects, volunteering, and clubs I’m involved in.
                    It’s a good place to get a snapshot of what I’m busy with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On GitHub, I share some of my coding projects and experiments.
                    If you’re curious about what I’ve built or am working on,
                    you can find more details there.

                <p>
                    Thanks for stopping by and reading this. If you reach out,
                    I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.
