# Maya Hazarika - Personal Website & Portfolio

Hello! My name is Maya and this is my personal website showcasing my projects, art, writing, and experiences as a 10th grader in the Boston area.

About

I created this site as a digital resume and diary of my interests and work. It features a scrapbook-inspired design meant to feel analog and non-digital, with a soft color palette and playful interactions.

- **My Art** - Ceramics and paintings gallery with lightbox viewer
- **Projects** - Showcase of programming projects with live demos and code
- **Writing** - Creative writing pieces and published articles

Tech

- **HTML5** - Structure and content
- **CSS3** - Styling with custom properties, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Interactive features and dynamic content loading
- **Fonts** - Google Fonts (Delius, SUSE Mono)

Design

I spent a lot of time deciding the color palette:

--maya-green: #97c026
--maya-blue: #aad3df
--maya-pink: #fea29b
--maya-orange: #ff9863
--maya-yellow: #f5dc79
--maya-dark: #434343
--maya-white: #ffffff

Features include:

Floating decorative icons that spin on hover
Paper-lift animations on content boxes
Image lightbox for art gallery
Responsive navigation that works on desktop and mobile
Accessibility considerations (focus states, reduced motion support)
