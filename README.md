hello! my name is maya and this is my portfolio/personal website

i intend to use it as a sort or resume/diary of all my projects and interests

the main sections are about me, contact, experiences, my art, projects, writing, and favorites

each section had its own page, linked through buttons at the top

the background is white with light gray dots for texture, color palette incluedes soft greens, blues, oranges, yellows, whites and pink

i tried to make it feel very analogy scrapbook-y and non digital

feel free to explore the pages and learn more about me and my interests. the site is simple and responsive, so it should work well on both desktop and mobile
