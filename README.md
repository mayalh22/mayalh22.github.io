# Maya Hazarika Personal Website & Portfolio

Hello! My name is Maya and this is my personal website showcasing my projects, art, writing, and experiences as a 10th grader in the Boston area. I created this site as a digital resume and diary of my interests and work. It features a scrapbook-inspired design meant to feel analog and non-digital, with a soft color palette and playful interactions.

I spent a lot of time deciding the color palette, editing icons and favicon and images:

--maya-green: #97c026
--maya-blue: #aad3df
--maya-pink: #fea29b
--maya-orange: #ff9863
--maya-yellow: #f5dc79

--maya-white: #ffffff

Feel free to work on this on your own! I don't know why you would, but you can.
