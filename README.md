# Maya Hazarika Personal Website & Portfolio

Hello! My name is Maya and this is my personal website showcasing my projects, art, writing, and experiences as a 10th grader in the Boston area. I created this site as a digital resume and diary of my interests and work. It features a scrapbook-inspired design meant to feel analog and non-digital, with a soft color palette and playful interactions.
