hello! my name is maya and this is my portfolio/personal website

i intend to use it as a sort or resume/diary of all my projects and interests

i am now a bit into the project but so far:

- there is 6 separate tabs/folders which each have thier own html file
- i have a 404 page in case of issues
- uploaded assets for my favorite books, movies, and albums
- added a lot of css with a color scheme

i am planning on adding some more js for functions, i still need to upload a decent amount of images, and i want to focus on interactiveness as well
