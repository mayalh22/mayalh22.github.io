                <h2>Things I Do</h2>
                <h3>jobs and things</h3>
                <p>
                    I work about eight hours each week at Mathnasium,
                    helping younger students gain confidence in math
                    through tutoring and guiding them with problems.
                    I also babysit my younger brother and his friends—
                    which definitely requires creativity and patience.
                </p>
                <h3>Volunteering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Museum of Science – Gallery Learning Volunteer</strong>
                        <p>
                            Every Sunday morning, I volunteer at Boston’s Museum
                            of Science, assisting with hands-on exhibits and
                            programs. I’ve supported activities in the Engineering
                            Design Workshop and the Hall of Human Life, helping
                            visitors explore and learn through interactive tasks.

                        <strong>Library of Congress – Remote Volunteer</strong>
                        <p>
                            I volunteer remotely for the Library of Congress,
                            transcribing historical documents to help preserve
                            and digitize important archives for public access.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Smithsonian Institution – Remote Volunteer</strong>
                        <p>Similarly, I contribute to Smithsonian projects,
                            transcribing field notes, letters, and journals online.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a dedicated Key Club member, I’ve completed over
                            100 hours volunteering in my community. My work has
                            included food drives, book donations, neighborhood
                            clean-ups, and mentoring younger students through
                            various local initiatives.

                <h3>at school</h3>
                <p>DECA, Key Club, Ceramics, Model UN, Quiz Bowl</p>
                <p>
                    At school, I’m involved in DECA, Key Club, Ceramics,
                    Model UN, and Quiz Bowl. I compete in DECA and went
                    to states last year. I enjoy ceramics, creating bowls
                    and dishes, attend Model UN conferences, and help my
                    school’s Quiz Bowl team. This year, I’ve also joined
                    Math Team, Girls Who Code, and Theater Tech.
                </p>
                <h3>summer stuff</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2025 - EDW at MIT, Harvard Academies</li>
                    <p> EDW stands for Engineering Design Workshop.
                        It’s a summer program at MIT where I get to work
                        on real engineering projects with other students.
                        We spend time brainstorming, building, and testing
                        things, which is super hands-on and really fun.
                        At Harvard Academies, I took part in a one-week
                        program all about financial consulting. It was
                        intense but gave me a peek into how businesses
                        solve money-related problems.
                    </p>
                    <li>2024 - Artemis at BU, 360 Squash, Fessenden Squash</li>
                    <p> Artemis is a computer science summer program at
                        Boston University just for girls. We learned lots
                        about coding and computer science ideas, and worked
                        on cool projects together. I also played squash in
                        two different programs — 360 Squash and Fessenden
                        Squash. Both helped me get better at the game and
                        taught me about teamwork and discipline.
                    </p>
                    <li>2023 - Weston Drama Workshop</li>
                    <p>In 2023, I joined the Weston Drama Workshop and took
                        part in their production of Grease. It was my first
                        real experience in theater, where I learned about
                        acting, stage production, and how everyone works
                        together to put on a show. It was a lot of fun and
                        a great way to try something new.
                    </p>
                    <li>2022 - ECO Camp Wellesley, Linx</li>
                    <p> ECO Camp Wellesley is an environmental camp where I
                        learned about nature, ecology, and ways to help the
                        planet. It was outdoors a lot and really opened my
                        eyes to conservation. At Linx, I was part of their
                        middle-school theater production of Descendants.
                        It was a lively show, and I enjoyed being part of a
                        creative team.
