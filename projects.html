        <h2>My Projects</h2>

        <h3>Electronic game table</h3>
        <p>With 2 other participants at Engineering Design Workshop at MIT,
        I built an electronic game table that can play 9 different games (wordle, backgammon, dnd, etc.).
        I used pygame to make the code and interface, and we built the table using 2 by 4s and various MIT resources.
        It was a super fun experience and I learned a lot about coding and building!
        </p>

        <h3>Digital dashboard</h3>
        <p>Digital Dashboard is a tool I made for myself: I am so used to switching between multiple tabs 
            and apps to keep track of my tasks, calendar, and notes that I wanted to create a single interface 
            to manage everything efficiently. I used react, tauri, and other js and ts technologies to build it.</p>

        <h3>Periodic Table</h3>
        <p>This is a periodic table project I made for myself to help visualize elements and their properties.
            It sorts elements by groups and periods, and you can click on each element to see more information about it.
            I used html, css, and js to build it. The elements are color coded by their group and period.
