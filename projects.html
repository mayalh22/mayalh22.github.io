            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <h3>Electronic Game Table</h3>
            <p>
                At MIT’s Engineering Design Workshop, I worked with two
                others to build an electronic game table. It plays nine
                different games—Wordle, Backgammon, DnD, and more. Our goal
                was to combine software and hardware into something fun and
                functional. I coded the interface using Pygame, and we built
                the table with 2x4s using MIT’s resources. The input is from
                players interacting with the touchscreen; output is the game
                display and responses. I learned about teamwork, coding for
                physical devices, and building tangible projects. It was a
                great challenge that deepened my interest in programming and
                making.

            <h3>Digital Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
                I built a Digital Dashboard to solve a personal problem: I
                was always switching between many tabs and apps to manage my
                tasks, calendar, and notes. I wanted one place to organize
                everything simply. I used React, Tauri, and JavaScript/TypeScript
                to build it. Inputs like tasks and events show clearly on one
                screen, helping me focus. The project taught me the power of
                modern web frameworks and desktop wrappers. I enjoy using it
                because it makes my workflow smoother.

            <h3>Periodic Table</h3>
            <p>
                This project is a visual, interactive periodic table I made
                for myself to explore elements and their properties better.
                Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it sorts elements by
                group and period. Clicking any element shows more info. Color
                coding highlights categories. Inputs are user clicks; output
                is element data displayed. I learned about organizing data
                visually and creating intuitive interfaces. It’s both a fun
                study aid and a way to connect coding with science.
            </p>

            <h3>Various Python Projects</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve done many Python projects in school ranging from simple
                to complex. These include a calculator, text-based adventure
                game, Wordle and Hangman clones, and a few specialized tools.
                The Equity Advisor Bot helps users reflect on fairness and
                biases in daily life. The Economic Analysis tool calculates
                the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality from data.
                The MCAS Analyzer uses Massachusetts test data to report
                scores and achievement levels. The Binary Logic Learner trains
                a perceptron to simulate AND gates. The Reality TV Predictor
                uses machine learning to forecast outcomes based on various
                factors. Each project processes inputs and produces useful
                outputs. These helped me understand coding concepts and real-
                world applications. I enjoy building tools that range from
                practical to playful.
            </p>

            <h3>Timer</h3>
            <p>
                Time Tree is a project that shows a growing tree as you focus
                and work. It provides a calming, visual way to track your
                productivity and encourages staying on task. I learned how
                design can support good habits and motivation. It’s a gentle
                reminder that being productive can feel rewarding and stress-
                free.
