            <h2>My Projects</h2>

            <h3>Electronic game table</h3>
            <p>With 2 other participants at Engineering Design Workshop at MIT,
                I built an electronic game table that can play 9 different games (wordle, backgammon, dnd, etc.).
                I used pygame to make the code and interface, and we built the table using 2 by 4s and various MIT
                resources.
                It was a super fun experience and I learned a lot about coding and building!
            </p>

            <h3>Digital dashboard</h3>
            <p>Digital Dashboard is a tool I made for myself: I am so used to switching between multiple tabs
                and apps to keep track of my tasks, calendar, and notes that I wanted to create a single interface
                to manage everything efficiently. I used react, tauri, and other js and ts technologies to build it.</p>

            <h3>Periodic Table</h3>
            <p>This is a periodic table project I made for myself to help visualize elements and their properties.
                It sorts elements by groups and periods, and you can click on each element to see more information about
                it.
                I used html, css, and js to build it. The elements are color coded by their group and period.
            </p>

            <h3>Various python projects</h3>
            <p>Some python projects I worked on during python programming in school: a calculator,
                a text-based adventure game, wordle, hangman, equity bot.py – Fairness Advisor Bot: A conversational
                tool designed to help users reflect on fairness and equity concerns in real-life situations by analyzing
                potential biases, power imbalances, and inclusivity issues.

                gini coeff.py – Economic Analysis Tool: Calculates and interprets the Gini coefficient to measure income
                inequality from a dataset, offering insight into economic disparities.

                grades.txt & mcas analyzer.py – MCAS Analyzer: Uses Massachusetts standardized test data to calculate
                average scaled scores, participation rates, and achievement levels. Generates customizable reports based
                on user input.

                perceptron & logic gate.py – Binary Logic Learner: Trains a perceptron model to simulate the AND logic
                gate, learning basic binary operations through weight updates and sigmoid activation.

                reality tv perceptron.py – Outcome Predictor: Uses a perceptron-based approach to predict a contestant’s
                outcome on a reality TV show based on their performance, popularity, and social relationships.

                .</p>

            <h3>Timer</h3>
            <p>Time Tree is a project which has a tree growing in the background as you focus and work.
                It helps visualize your productivity and encourages you to stay on task.</p>
