                <h3>Electronic Game Table</h3>
                <p>
                    At MIT’s Engineering Design Workshop, I worked with two
                    others to build an electronic game table. It plays nine
                    different games—Wordle, Backgammon, DnD, and more. Our goal
                    was to combine software and hardware into something fun and
                    functional. I coded the interface using Pygame, and we built
                    the table with 2x4s using MIT’s resources. The input is from
                    players interacting with the touchscreen; output is the game
                    display and responses. I learned about teamwork, coding for
                    physical devices, and building tangible projects. It was a
                    great challenge that deepened my interest in programming and
                    making.

                <h3>Digital Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    I built a Digital Dashboard to solve a personal problem: I
                    was always switching between many tabs and apps to manage my
                    tasks, calendar, and notes. I wanted one place to organize
                    everything simply. I used React, Tauri, and JavaScript/TypeScript
                    to build it. Inputs like tasks and events show clearly on one
                    screen, helping me focus. The project taught me the power of
                    modern web frameworks and desktop wrappers. I enjoy using it
                    because it makes my workflow smoother.

                <h3>Periodic Table</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is a visual, interactive periodic table I made
                    for myself to explore elements and their properties better.
                    Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it sorts elements by
                    group and period. Clicking any element shows more info. Color
                    coding highlights categories. Inputs are user clicks; output
                    is element data displayed. I learned about organizing data
                    visually and creating intuitive interfaces. It’s both a fun
                    study aid and a way to connect coding with science.

                <h3>Various Python Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve done many Python projects in school ranging from simple
                    to complex. These include a calculator, text-based adventure
                    game, Wordle and Hangman clones, and a few specialized tools.
                    The Equity Advisor Bot helps users reflect on fairness and
                    biases in daily life. The Economic Analysis tool calculates
                    the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality from data.
                    The MCAS Analyzer uses Massachusetts test data to report
                    scores and achievement levels. The Binary Logic Learner trains
                    a perceptron to simulate AND gates. The Reality TV Predictor
                    uses machine learning to forecast outcomes based on various
                    factors. Each project processes inputs and produces useful
                    outputs. These helped me understand coding concepts and real-
                    world applications. I enjoy building tools that range from
                    practical to playful.

                <h3>Timer</h3>
                <p>
                    Time Tree is a project that shows a growing tree as you focus
                    and work. It provides a calming, visual way to track your
                    productivity and encourages staying on task. I learned how
                    design can support good habits and motivation. It’s a gentle
                    reminder that being productive can feel rewarding and stress-
                    free.
